<p class="text-xl leading-relaxed mb-12">
  MyWebClass.org is a design education platform that teaches the history
  and practice of visual design through authentic, fully-implemented website demos.
</p>

<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p>
  We believe the best way to learn design is by seeing real examples.
  Not just screenshots or mockups, but living, breathing implementations
  that demonstrate how design principles become functional websites.
</p>

<h2>For Students</h2>
<p>
  Explore our gallery to understand how design movements like Swiss
  International Style, Bauhaus, and Brutalism translate to the web.
  Then, submit your own demos to demonstrate your understanding.
</p>

<h2>For Educators</h2>
<p>
  Use MyWebClass.org as a teaching resource. Our instructor tools
  allow you to review student submissions, provide feedback, and
  curate the gallery.
</p>

<h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
<p>
  This site itself is built using Swiss International Style — a neutral,
  grid-based approach that won't compete visually with the diverse design
  styles featured in our gallery. We practice what we teach.
